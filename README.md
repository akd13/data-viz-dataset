This repo contains instructions for how to prepare a comprehensive dataset of images with captions/descriptions for blind and low 
vision users.

We prepare data from the following sources:
1. SciCap dataset: [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t1sjqesl0pynaxo/scicap_data.zip?dl=0)
2. WiT dataset: [here](https://wit3.fbk.eu/mt.php?release=2017-01-trnted&source=en&target=de&split=train)
3. Twitter (scraped using tweepy and keywords)
